1. Add footer with Contact Us
2. Custom user hook to check if user is signed in on partnership letter page and that will pick they can access the holdings PDF or not.
3. Add a Seraya Logo instead of FloatUI right now

Additional:

1. Lazy load images and with blurry placeholder first while main is loading
2. Delete all the console.log's when everything is done
