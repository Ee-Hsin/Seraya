# Seraya

TODO:

1. React-Routing to setup secondary pages for Partnership Letters, Blog, and Login

- Will need dynamic routing for when in Partnership Letters page
- Will need a \* for error page
- Need to figure out how to either use Link with smooth scrolling and working with IDs, or keep the Strategy section as anchor tags and figure out the smooth scroll.

2. Firebase authentication to enabe users to login
3. Custom user hook to check if user is signed in on partnership letter page and that will pick they can access the holdings PDF or not.
4. Make Seraya hero look better on iphone devices (blocked by background leaf rn)
5. Add footer with Contact Us

Additional:

1. Lazy load images and with blurry placeholder first while main is loading
