# Seraya

TODO:

1. Add a Contact Us page
2. Custom user hook to check if user is signed in on partnership letter page and that will pick they can access the holdings PDF or not.
3. Add ability to subscribe to blog with footer
4. Add a Seraya Logo instead of FloatUI right now

Additional:

1. Lazy load images and with blurry placeholder first while main is loading
2. Delete all the console.log's when everything is done
3. Fix bug where navbar pushes items down (in mobile) when it drops from the absolute top, but not when it drops when it is lower.

Letters Page:

-

Blog Page:

- Should be a list of blogs with the name, a photo, and then a shortened description.
- Render them directly from front end first, then switch them into being retrieved from Firebase.
- Create an admin UI to create future blogs as well and send them into firebase. Will get admin by manually adding 'admin:true' to my user in database.
- Add Pagnation once received more blogs
